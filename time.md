# Time management

This file is a breakdown of how time was spent to complete the work

1. Project set up, the following tasks were completed to set up the project - 30 minutes
   1. Installing composer on WSL 
   2. Installing the symfony project
   3. Installing Symfony CLI
   4. Skimming through Symfony docs to refresh myself on things such as how annotated routing worked. I work a lot with Laravel and have not done to much in the past with symfony
2. Development of CheckController class - 35 minutes
   1. Each method took me roughly around 10-15 minutes to complete
3. Testing - 15 minutes
   1. I ran a good few words/examples through each function to ensure it was all working correctly. Testing did make me realise i had made an error in one of the functions by not making strings lowercase on comparison.
4. Creating a git repo and pushing the code - 5 minutes
